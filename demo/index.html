  <h2>My awesome article that I am writing actively</h2>
  <p contenteditable="">
    Don't you love this article!? It's the best article.
    Now don't get on my case, I know, I haven't written anything in awhile.
    And when I do write, it's not really logical, but at least I got the 4pts
    on the assignment. So this is for class and I was told to write two paragraphs.
  </p>
  <p contenteditable="">
    This is what an additional paragraph looks like (LOL). So here we're going to
    talk today about Docker. Docker is a word that I hadn't heard before, but you can
    <a href="https://lmgtfy.app/?q=docker" target="_blank">Google it and it comes up with results</a>.
    Well, I guess I need to run, see you next assignment where I phone it in completely!

    // @feedback
    // this little rewrite to your demo makes it possible to see what
    // it's like when we visualize it where it would be within an app of some kind
    // also this sample text is not making fun of any of you, it's more or less what
    // someone turned in one semester thinking that I don't read articles.
    // This demo now shows 2 possible positions for the whos-here widget and also
    // will force you to be mindful of what would happen if there are multiple instances
    // on a page or that you'll need some variable set somewhere for identifying 
    // which URL the 'whos-here' widget is for. This way it can relate the data
    // appropriately.

    // yes, i am this lazy
    function dqs(sel){ return document.querySelector(sel);}
    // click handler for btn1
    dqs("#add1").addEventListener("click", (e) => {
      dqs("#wh1").addUser();
    });
    // click handler for btn2
